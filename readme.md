ECM, 7Z, Recurse and Do Stuff
=============================

What's this
===========
More windows batch, focused on retro gaming activities but really fulfilling the role of being a generic 'apply this operation to every matching file all the way down the tree, replacing as you go"

What's it do?
=============
Pretty much that, but these implementations deal with un-archiving and un-ECM-ing (which is a technique in retro-gaming to reduce disk image file size)

How do I run these?
===================
Oh c'mon.....

Anything else to think about?
=============================
No
